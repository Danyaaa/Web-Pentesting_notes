- sometimes the organization is not the owner of the IP address

## 1- Gather info about the organization 

- WHOIS (owner of the IP and domain names)
   - whois <domain> 
   - https://whois.domaintools.com/

## 2- IPS of the target 

- nslookup 
   - reverse nslookup (nslookup -type=PTR <ip>)
   - nslookup -querytype=ANY
   - to get all records (A, MX CNAME, NAME SERVERS)

## 3- Identify individual targets 

- using nslookup to get all the IPS associated to each subdomain
