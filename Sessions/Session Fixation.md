### [+] Session Fixation is forcing the user to use a custom session of the attacker

Rules:

    1-  the attacker has a valid session id 
    2- forcing the user (if session id is embedded in the url rather than inside the cookies) â†’ malicious link 

- the attacker might not be authenticated 

   - most web sites start a session without being authenticated and remain the ID the same after login
